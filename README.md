# scrape_vsco

This just scrapes an users entire profile feed from VSCO. This is a very "hack-y" solution and may or may not break at any point in time.

# Use:
You'll need Python 2.x. 
You need to have PIL installed as well.

Once you have all that installed, simply load up idle or just run this script and call enter the username you would like to download from:

```python
>>> Username: <EXAMPLE>
```

Replace <EXAMPLE> with the username.

*Note this is a infinite loop. To exit, enter "exit" or "quit" into the prompt*
