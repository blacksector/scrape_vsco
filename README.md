# scrape_vsco

This just scrapes an users entire profile feed from VSCO. This is a very "hack-y" solution and may or may not break at any point in time

# Use:
You'll need Python 2.x. Once you have that installed, simply load up idle or just run this script and call the scrape_vsco function with a username as a function parameter like this:

```python
scrape_vsco("example")
```

Done!
